# Hotel Booking Cancellation Prediction

This project predicts the probability that a hotel booking will be cancelled or result in a no-show.

## Goals

- Build an end-to-end ML pipeline:
  - Data ingestion and preprocessing
  - Feature engineering
  - Model training and evaluation
  - Online prediction API
  - Batch scoring script

- Design it like a real product, with clear structure and extensibility.

## Project Structure (initial)

- `src/hcp_model/` - core Python modules (features, training, serving)
- `data/raw/` - raw booking datasets (not committed)
- `data/processed/` - cleaned / feature-ready datasets (not committed)
- `notebooks/` - EDA and experiments
- `models/` - saved model artifacts (not committed)
- `config/` - configuration files (to be added)
